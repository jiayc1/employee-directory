# employee-directory


In this project, we are building an employee directory using the react app. 

User Story: 

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


The directory have names and information coming from randomuser.api (https://randomuser.me/)

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
